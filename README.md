# ICBM Reborn
The mod adds over twenty custom explosives, each of which are also available as missiles, minecarts, and sometimes even grenades. Some of the explosions have some pretty exotic effects, including nuclear fallout, contagious virus deployment, and all-consuming black holes! Combined with a few added features like poisonous spikes and player tracking, the mod creates an utterly unique experience that strikes the perfect balance of pushing boundaries without losing the spirit of the vanilla game.
